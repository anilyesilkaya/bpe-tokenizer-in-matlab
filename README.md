["Build a Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) Tokenizer From Scratch in MATLAB"](https://anilyesilkaya.github.io/bpe-tokenizer-in-matlab/)

In this project, we are building a simple Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE)-based tokenizer from scratch in MATLAB as a proof-of-concept. The project has been inspired by Andrej Karpathy's ["Let's build the GPT Tokenizer"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zduSFxRajkE) video.
